                    <h2>The Curious Case of Virat Kohli
                        <br>
                        <small>March 4th 2002</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>This is a name that has been doing its share of rounds among the cricket fraternity in this last decade. From the wacky 18-year-old recruit to 50m followers on Instagram, he has certainly skyrocketed and his batting records are unparalleled. However, I do not wish to utilize this post to advocate his technical prowess with the bat. As an ardent fan of his, I am just offering my 2 cents on how things plausibly stack up for him as of Jan 2020.


It has been, unscrupulously, an appalling tour for India, by all standards. One can claim that the team emerged victorious in half the matches on tour, but with a clear introspection on their performances, it has been NZ’s repeated bollix, especially in the crunch overs. And you don’t say this very often, but one player who has failed to put his hand up is Captain King Kohli himself.


It was not only his numbers which were new flanged, but also his mental approach toward the tour. The skipper, who is known for his belligerence on the field, went to NZ with a rather uncustomary attitude. From being overridden in the WC semi by the kiwis to deeming them as “so nice” and chatting with Kane Williamson on life, it seems as if he was looking at the tour with a tinge of trifle, given that impact players like Boult and Ferguson were missing early. on.


Notwithstanding the 45(32) in the first game on tour, his performances have routinely declined, even to an extent of meager single digits in the tests. With his knowledge in mind, it is quite difficult to believe that he was the man who aced the moving ball and looked a comprehensive player against the opposition he had scuffled against 6 years ago.


And Virat, who is well known from his ability to bounce back from lackluster outings, displayed no inclination to ameliorate. He made a valiant statement in the 2018 England tour after a scanty 2014 tour. He brought the Australian bowlers to his feet in 2014 with the twin Adelaide tons after a humbling series in 2012. He conquered South Africa after a see-saw 2013 series. Given his history of rising to the occasion, irrespective of conditions, he was fully antipodal on this tour.


If he has shown resolution anywhere, it has been his answers to the media. Vocalizing that ODI’s are not too relevant speaks volumes of the mental atmosphere in the dressing room. This was a statement even Head Coach Shastri would make later on after a thrashing in the first test. With this on hand, it remains a mystery as to why the Australia home series resurgence was greatly commemorated. Knowing that the team has eliminated one format from their preparations, it portrays that the players may not be giving their 100% on the field and “being the best versions of themselves”, which is a mantra the captain lives on.


It was also astonishing to see his counterstatement that he was a no-show. With a careful reading between the lines, it is relatively simple to make out that he was merely concealing by saying that he was “batting well”. With all these years, this is certainly not the Virat Kohli we know. IF there is a dip in form, he will always own up, pull up his socks, and return with a bang.


For Virat Kohli, rage and determination have always driven him to success. Somehow, that piece of him was vacant. In the 2019 series against WI, it was the repeated sledging from the West Indians which got him his desire to prove himself with a match-winning 94. In the decider game, it was his constant self motivation that got him to score a quickfire 70. It was his drive which got him to win Man of Series against Australia. The humble attitude from the kiwis just weeded out that aspect from him. Even with the tour ending, while he had claimed collective responsibility of the batsmen, not once did he recognize his batting drop.


Only time will tell if he can once again re-establish himself, but the team is in dire need of him. India will definitely need a golden run from him if they will have any hope of winning the WT20. Till then, I can only wish that he takes the world by surprise in the coming SA series and the IPL.</p>

                    <h2>CoronaVirus-Economic Impacts
                        <br>

                    <p>It is beyond dispute that the new decade had a high-octane outset with the IRAN-USA deal and the Puerto Rico earthquake. However, in the last months, there has been a cogent impetus which has been comfortably driving the minds of mankind: Coronavirus. What is now an SOS alert can be attributed to a mere accident at an animal market in Wuhan, China. While, at this point, we are prominently looking to establish a well-built body defense system against the virus, it is salient to mention the additional ways in which the alert could be a threat to our society.

The virus has been taking a massive toll on the global economy, especially the USA and, not to mention, China. And, as a result, dependant countries have been potential victims of this recession.

While President Trump is finding the blue sky in the circumstance by saying that “People will spend their money”, it is imperative to assess the overall economic situation of the USA. The Dow Jones industrial average(A stock performance indicator) had its record biggest plummet of 1191 points, flustering investor hopes. After the overall stock market gained by a whopping 29% in 2019, investors have lost trillions of dollars due to the fall, and it is still uncertain as to how long this will continue. Although the GDP grew by 2% in the first quarter of the year, economists are looking at a dipped 1.1% growth in the coming quarter. Additionally, there have been drastic cuts in the Federal Reserve interest rates, showing us that the USA government is treating this situation no differently than the 2007 recession.

Notwithstanding the mega-drop, President Trump was still not pleased with the cuts, saying that the rates should have dropped more, but that’s a topic for another post.

In parallel, the epidemic also rubs salt into the wounds of the UK’s economic setbacks since its exit from the EU. The island already had a low-key growth rate of 1.2%, much below its average. And to top it up, the consistently dipping government bond returns have caused the Band of New England to slash the interest rate to 0.25%. Yes, such monetary policies are quite instinctive, but a more effective way to boost the economy in the long term would be for the government to cut taxes and increase its expenditure and the real GDP.

British firms have also been apprised that at least 20% of their labor force could be out sick. With already more than 350 confirmed cases in the country, it is estimated that a total of 6 million workers would not be present at work, not including those taking off to care for the ill. It goes without saying, this is a massive blow for an already stagnant economy.

On the other end of the world, the coronavirus has caused slow production in China, affecting countries like India, which has taken a 348m dollar trade impact. In a way, the virus is the perfect indicator of how dependant the world is on China’s product manufacturing. Looking at the massive trade hits in the chemical and textile industries in India, it is needless to say that the EU and the USA ‘s 15.6 billion and 5.8 billion dollar hit respectively is a debacle.

There has been a visible 2% fall in production rates in China. In fact, due to these receding economies, Oyo Hotels, a hotel company based in India, has made a bold decision to fire 6000 full-time employees in China. , Hotel occupancy rates have been in freefall, leaving at least 8 out of 10 rooms unoccupied. The hotel industries incurred gigantic losses, especially in the time of the recent Chinese new year, which is a peak travel time.

Specifically, who else loses out?

Unquestionably, barring the general world economy, particular professions will come under fire, especially in countries with cheap labor.

Maids and cooks will certainly be turned back as a mere precaution. With the case count on the rise, it will increasingly become arduous to track down where the maids have gone and explore potential ends for the virus spread. As a result, people in such professions will have to resort to vicious cycles of borrowing, and with a very meager income, worsen their financial debt.

To add on, a myriad of social buildings and schools have been shut down. So, it is not only housemaids who are losing out, but also those the majority of them who are employed in these places.

Successively, those involved in transport will face unemployment. Bus conductors, drivers, will not have an income inflow for these weeks as the public would be against traveling with a crowd.

Needless to say, the tourist industry is taking immense damage. Looking at Goa, India, the Goan people feed off from tourism and mining, which are primary sectors there. Mining has already been banned in India due to the dumping of low-grade ores and the tourism hit is the final nail in the coffin for Goans. Arbitrarily, the Goan government is currently looking to attain back some mining rights to keep the mining dependents running.

And an immediate effect, as we have already started seeing now, would be economic collapses due to less disposable income and subsequent expenditure.

So many lost, so does anyone benefit???

The answer is Yes. Apart from these FMCG hand sanitizers, with any economic overturn, a collection of industries will always make hay. In this case, we need to assess how we will continue to live and learn, given that many of us are practically on house arrest. With schools and universities being shut down, this is the perfect occasion for online learning tools to get off the mark. Coursera has made around 3000 courses free to increase customer demand. As educational institutes have started creating online classes, software like Microsoft teams and outlook will look to capitalize on this window

Not to mention, time at home awards us more TV and Netflix time!!!. Because work has taken a backseat, and sports matches have been shut down, TV channels and companies like Amazon Prime, will have far more viewership. In fact, Netflix has introduced a google chrome extension called Netflix Party, where people can virtually form groups and watch movies.

The way forward

The virus has its set of merits and drawbacks on our society, but undoubtedly more of the latter. Economic growth is coming to a standstill and at this point, responsibly taking precautions is what will pull us out of this hole. With fatality out of the picture, all that remains is the prevention of its spread, and we can do this through thoughtful decisions and less panic. The faster this message reaches the globe, the faster we can start traveling to our favorite destinations and start watching our treasured sports matches.

                    <h2>What is Badla Financing and why was it banned?

                    </h2>
                    <p>Amid a pandemic, as we all are segregated, I am going to rewind the clocks to an old Indian stock trading system. Back in the day, when firm ground-rules on stock trading were not established, investors would capitalize on the recourse to carry forward their stock purchase transactions.

Before any further discussion, it is essential to explain what “carrying forward ” means. Prior to any formal stock transaction , the buyer and seller, through recognized brokers, would simply agree on a deal and propose a settlement date among themselves. The deal would typically consist of how many shares to be sold/bought and the price that must be paid on the settlement date. Only on the settlement date, the formal transaction would proceed. Now, carrying forward comes into play when either party decides to postpone the transactions beyond the settlement date. Earlier, in the Indian stock market, such practices were deemed acceptable, but today, there are stern limits on carrying forward transactions.

Carrying forward transactions poses a high dose of uncertainty and financial risk, and subsequently, it was superseded with a concept known as a futures contract. Here, both the buyer and seller will formally agree to transact on a particular day, with a specific amount to escape the up-shots of a volatile market.

So, badla financing, in essence, is a stock trading system wherein either party decides to carry forward per the current market trend. And depending on whether the stock market index is increasing(AKA forwardation or contango), or decreasing(AKA backwardation), the scenario will influence the decision making of either the buyer or seller. It is formally known as ‘badla’ if the buyer decides to postpone the transactions or ‘undha badla’, or reverse badla if the seller postpones the stock transaction. In both these cases, the stock market will act as a median to determine a suitable interest rate given the demand for the stocks.

Let us consider the following scenario wherein an investor(Person A ) is involved in the stock purchases of a company known as TM-MOTORS

At present, let us assume that TM-MOTORS is selling shares for 2000 rupees each and Person A considers that a massive markdown and speculates the price to rise shortly. However, currently, A lacks the money to purchase the shares of TM-MOTORS. It is in these scenarios where eager badla financers can make hay. Let us say that there is a badla financer Y, who has enough money to purchase the stocks. A can request Y to purchase the shares on A’s behalf and carry forward the payment for the shares up to the point where A can afford the shares. Nonetheless, A will be required to pay interest to Y for the delay, which would be determined via the stock exchange using the forces of demand and supply for that particular share. Fundamentally, this outcome is a concession for both A and Y. A will not need to buy the stock at its increased future price, rather just pay an interest, and Y would gain the interest amount itself. The badla financers can either be independent or a contact via the stockbroker.

The opposite of this is known as ‘undha-badla’, whereas you may have already guessed, the market is in backwardation, meaning the future stock prices are lower than those of the existing. Here, the seller will reckon on carrying forward the ‘selling’ of stocks as if the prices are waning, the seller will prefer to sell the stock at its diminished future price. And, as mentioned earlier, the seller will pay a badla interest for carrying forward the transaction.

Badla trading practices saw quick booms in the market as it was a comfort for all parties involved. Badla also brought in high volumes of stock trading in the early 1990s.

If Badla trading was a win-win, why did the government ban it???

Badla trading has a see-sawed past in the Indian Stock market. It was first banned in 1993 by the SEBI due to its anomalies, partially brought back in 1995, and finally banned in 2001. So, what caused this skepticism in the SEBI?

THE ANSWER: The Harshad Mehta Scam

In 1992, Harshad Mehta(An Indian stockbroker), made the front page for one of the biggest scams of the Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE).

Back in the 90s, all investment banks were required to buy and reserve some government securities. So, if a bank’s capital was down-swinging, the bank would sell the government securities and re-buy them with a bit of interest. Harshad Mehta, a clever intermediate broker, would position himself in the buying and selling of government bonds. Whenever a bank needed to purchase these bonds, he would take money from the bank and in return, take some time to find a suitable seller. He immensely carried forward these transactions and just used the money to invest in stocks. Stock prices skyrocketed to greater limits and Harshad repeated this with almost all the big commercial banks in India. In due course, when the banks clamored for their money, he would just find another bank who was ready to give their money, and this recursively continued.

The more money he collected, the more jolts he induced in the stock prices. He even went to the extent of printing fake receipts to show to banks for their money! And as stock prices were soaring higher than ever, more people began investing soon.

Consequently, by nature, the stock market crashed. It was a mere repercussion of the hyper-inflation beyond the utility of the stocks themselves. Banks found out about his receipt frauds, excessive carrying forward, and his vicious borrowing cycles. Not to mention, the owner of Vijaya Bank took his life upon this news.!!! Banks lost thousands of crores and Harshad was caught in an enormous debt.

Upon the crash, the officials sat down and imposed restrictions on carrying forward transactions, and naturally, Badla was banned. It was often briefly reintroduced, just to inject some fuel into the stock market, but in 2001, it was eradicated.

The scandal has paved the way for tighter trading regulations in the Indian stock market today. On a related note, let us see that the current stock prices don’t continue plummeting by doing our bit to fight COVID19. I hope to have given you an interesting read while stranded at home, and if you liked the article, a subscription would be most kindly appreciated!!!
